  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <h2>Snap! has been developed by Jens M&ouml;nig, an independent German programmer.</h2>
  <h2>[Have Jens input more here...]</h2>
  <h2>Jens's partner in the design of Snap! is Brian Harvey, Senior Lecturer SOE Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.  Brian has been teaching kids to program computers since 1979, first in Logo, then in Scheme, and now in Snap!.  He is the author of the three-volume _Computer Science Logo Style_ series, aimed at teenagers.</h2>
  <h2>Jens learned to program in the Smalltalk community, and Brian in the Lisp community; Snap! therefore has its roots in both functional and object oriented approaches to programming.</h2>
  <h2>Snap! is the programming language used in _The Beauty and Joy of Computing_, the introductory computer science course for non-CS majors at Berkeley. Brian is co-developer, with Dan Garcia, of the BJC curriculum.  We are actively spreading this course to high schools, and BJC students and teachers are the primary users of Snap!.</h2>
  <h2>The design of Snap! is obviously based on that of Scratch, the pioneering visual programming language for kids 8 and up from the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.  BYOB (Build Your Own Blocks), the previous version of Snap!, was in fact based on the Scratch 1.4 code base.  (Snap! is a completely new implementation using Javascript and HTML5 Canvas.)  We gratefully acknowledge the generous support we've been given by the MIT Scratch Team.</h2>
  <h2>Our contribution was to extend the visual metaphors of Scratch for older learners (high school and up) to include first class procedures, first class lists, first class sprite objects with inheritance, and first class continuations.</h2>
