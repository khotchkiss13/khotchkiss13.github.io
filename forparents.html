  <h1>For Parents</h1>
  <h2>Snap! is a visual programming language designed to be both easy for beginners and powerful enough for more advanced learners.</h2>
  <h2>We were inspired by <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, and are grateful for the encouragement and support we've had from the Scratch Team, who are part of the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. Most of the visual design of Snap! was taken directly from Scratch.</h2>
  <h2>But Snap! is aimed at a somewhat older audience than Scratch.  They target kids 8-14, although older teens and adults have found it rewarding also.  As a result, the Scratch designers deliberately left out some capabilities that they thought their audience don't need and might find confusing.  Our target audience is high school and undergraduate students, ages 14-20.  So we've added first class lists and first class procedures to Snap!.  (There are video tutorials for these aspects of the language elsewhere on the site.)</h2>
  <h2>One thing that <i>isn't</i> different from Scratch is that we intend this site and this software to be safe for kids.  Because our target audience is older, we're slightly looser than the Scratch Team; they try to keep everything on the site more or less G-rated, whereas we try for PG-13. That means, in particular, that we don't censor polite discussion of political controversies</h2>
  <h2>Your child does not have to give us any personal information to program in Snap!.  However, it's much more convenient to create an account with us, so that you can store programming projects on our server.  For this we require an email address.  (If your child is under 13, we ask for <i>your</i> address, and you should help him or her with the account setup.) We do not ask for names or physical addresses.  THERE IS NO ADVERTISING HERE, AND WE DO NOT ALLOW THIRD PARTIES TO COLLECT YOUR CHILD'S EMAIL ADDRESS.  Programming projects can be private or can be shared with the Snap! community; kids generally prefer to share.  We therefore discourage the inclusion of identifying information in projects.</h2>
  <h2>Snap! is used in high school and college computer science classes; your child may have discovered Snap! in such a class.  In that case, the teacher of the class may have access to otherwise private projects created as class assignments.

  <h2><a href="tos.html">Terms of Service</a></h2>
  <h2>If your child has created a Snap! account without your permission and you would like us to delete it, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> and provide the account login name and/or the email address used to create the account. Please also give us a phone number where we can call you to confirm that you are the child's parent.</h2>
