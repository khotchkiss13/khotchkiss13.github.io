  <h1><img src="./tos_files/Logo5.png" alt="Snap!" height="50px" style="position: relative; top: 7px"> Terms of Service</h1>

  <h4>Welcome to the <img src="./tos_files/small-logo.png" alt="Snap!" height="35px" style="position: relative; top: 7px"> user community!</h4>

  <h2><img src="./tos_files/small-logo.png" alt="Snap!" height="30px" style="position: relative; top: 5px"> is a visual computer programming
  language targeted mainly at users ages 12-20, although everyone is welcome
  here.  Its design is deeply inspired by
  <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>, a pioneering language
  and programming community for an overlapping but somewhat younger
  range of users, from the
  Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.</h2>
  <h2><img src="./tos_files/small-logo.png" alt="Snap!" height="30px" style="position: relative; top: 5px"> is provided by the University
  of California, Berkeley, with funding from the National Science
  Foundation and the MioSoft Corporation.  MioSoft also provides
  the server and software for our cloud storage capability.</h2>
  <h2>Our goal is to foster a friendly, welcoming, safe community of
  <img src="./tos_files/small-logo.png" alt="Snap!" height="30px" style="position: relative; top: 5px"> users.  These Terms of Service
  have that goal in mind.</h2>

  <h4>Use of the software</h4>

  <h2><img src="./tos_files/small-logo.png" alt="Snap!" height="30px" style="position: relative; top: 5px"> is free software.  It is licensed
  under the
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl">GNU
  Affero General Public License</a>, which permits unlimited use
  for any purpose by anyone, but does not allow proprietary modified
  versions of the software; if you make a modified version of
  <img src="./tos_files/small-logo.png" alt="Snap!" height="30px" style="position: relative; top: 5px">, you must make it available under
  the same terms as our version, including the provision of source code.</h2>

  <h2>(To download the <img src="./tos_files/small-logo.png" alt="Snap!" height="30px" style="position: relative; top: 5px"> source code,
  click on the <img src="./tos_files/small-logo.png" alt="Snap!" height="30px" style="position: relative; top: 5px"> icon in the top left
  corner of the <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/run">programming</a>
  page and choose "Download source.")</h2>
  <h2>You do not have to have a user account or provide any personal
  information to use <img src="./tos_files/small-logo.png" alt="Snap!" height="30px" style="position: relative; top: 5px">.  (See our
  <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/privacy.html">privacy policy</a> for more details.)</h2>
  <h2>You may not attempt to disrupt other people's use of this site,
  whether by denial of service attacks, accessing private data, or
  any other means.  If you want to prove how clever you are, go pick
  on the CIA.</h2>

  <h4>Private use of our cloud storage</h4>

  <h2>If you create an account on this site, you can store your
  <img src="./tos_files/small-logo.png" alt="Snap!" height="30px" style="position: relative; top: 5px"> projects on our cloud server.
  You can save projects privately, just for your own use, or you
  can share them publicly for any other user of our site to see.</h2>

  <h2>We will not examine the contents of any project you store
  privately.  We believe that such private storage is not legally
  "publication" and that you are not breaking any laws by using
  copyrighted material in private projects.</h2>
  <h2>We may establish limits on the total amount of storage you may
  use on our server.  Also, our server is provided for the purpose
  of programming in <img src="./tos_files/small-logo.png" alt="Snap!" height="30px" style="position: relative; top: 5px">; you may not
  store media (e.g., your entire music library) not intended for use
  in programming projects.</h2>

  <h4>Public posting of projects</h4>

  <h2>If you share projects publicly, then you must abide by additional
  rules:</h2>

  <h2>Anything you share is available to other users for any purpose,
  including the sharing of modified versions of your projects.  By
  sharing a project, you are agreeing to license it under the
  <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative
  Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a> License.  (Fine
  print: If you want your project to be considered "free software"
  then you should waive the "NonCommercial" part of the license,
  but we do not impose this choice on you.)  This license also
  applies to any media (images, sounds, etc.) you share on this site.</h2>
  <h2>If you do use someone else's work in creating your project,
  you should give them credit for it, in your project notes.</h2>
  <h2>Our community includes children, and people of all cultures,
  religions, political views, and so on.  You may not share anything
  that could reasonably be considered offensive to others.  We reserve
  the right to revoke the shared status of anything that, in our sole
  judgment, is offensive to our community standards.  (There is a fine
  line between the free expression of ideas, which we encourage, and
  offensiveness, which we don't.  You can argue with us through our
  <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/contact.html">contact page</a>, but by using this site you
  agree that our judgment is final.)  In case of repeated violations,
  we may remove your account entirely.</h2>
  <h2>In particular, you may not share anything that is illegal in the
  United States of America, where our servers are located, including
  pornography and hate speech as defined by US law.</h2>
  <h2>Also in particular, you may not share anything that insults or
  attacks other users of the site.  Put yourself in the other person's
  shoes before you post any comments about anyone else.</h2>
  <h2>You may not share any material copyrighted by someone else.
  We are required by law to remove any such material if we are
  given proper notice under the terms of the Digital Millennium
  Copyright Act.  (See <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/dmca.html">here</a> to notify us
  of a violation.)</h2>
  <h2>Finally, please do not share any personally identifiable information
  (such as your name, address, birthday, etc.) in your projects.</h2>

  <h4>No Liability</h4>

  <h2><b>BY USING THIS SITE OR THE
  <img src="./tos_files/small-logo.png" alt="Snap!" height="35px" style="position: relative; top: 7px"> SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE THAT NEITHER
  THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA NOR THE MIOSOFT CORPORATION PROVIDES
  ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER</b>, since the services are provided at no cost.
  This includes the possibility of damage to your computer.</h2>
  <h2>(We do not think that there is any significant chance of damage to your
  computer, including its software and data, even if you download other
  people's shared projects.  <img src="./tos_files/small-logo.png" alt="Snap!" height="30px" style="position: relative; top: 5px"> is implemented within your browser using Javascript,
  which was designed with security restrictions on what any Javascript program,
  including <img src="./tos_files/small-logo.png" alt="Snap!" height="30px" style="position: relative; top: 5px">, can do.  Most
  web sites use Javascript, and if a security hole should ever turn up in
  Javascript, the bad guys will attack popular sites such as cnn.com or
  google.com long before they get around to us.  Still, if there's ever a
  problem with Javascript, it won't be under our control and we can't take
  responsibility for it.  Note: Despite the name, Javascript is unrelated
  to Java, which <i>has</i> had security problems, but is not used by
  our site.)</h2>
  <h2>A less severe but more likely problem is that if you program in <img src="./tos_files/small-logo.png" alt="Snap!" height="30px" style="position: relative; top: 5px"> from a mobile device using a
  cellular network, you may run over your data plan's limit and incur large
  usage fees from your carrier.  We're not responsible for that, either.  Get on
  a Wifi network before you start programming!</h2>
