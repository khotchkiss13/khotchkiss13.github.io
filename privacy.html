  <h1><img src="./privacy_files/Logo5.png" alt="Snap!" height="50px" style="position: relative; top: 6px"> Privacy Policy</h1>

  <h2>Your privacy and safety online are very important to us. To protect your privacy, we limit what we collect and what we publish on the website. Although, as a nonprofit educational institution, we are technically exempt from the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we are voluntarily following its rules about data collection from children under 13.</h2>
  <h2>We follow industry standards to maintain the security of our web server.  However, we cannot absolutely guarantee that malicious third parties will be unable to break into our database.  This privacy policy explains how our authorized staff and contractors will use your information.</h2>
  <h1>Information We Collect</h1>

  <h4>Using our software</h4>

  <h2>You can <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/run">program in
  <img src="./privacy_files/small-logo.png" alt="Snap!" height="25px" style="position: relative; top: 5px"></a> without providing us with any
  personally identifiable information at all.  We do not record
  any information about the programs you write unless you choose
  to save projects on our cloud server.  (You can instead save
  projects only on your own computer.)  You can also, without
  providing any information, download our example projects, libraries,
  and other public media.</h2>

  <a name="account">
  <h4>Creating a <img src="./privacy_files/Logo5.png" alt="Snap!" height="30px" style="position: relative; top: 5px"> account</h4>

  <h2>If you wish to save the projects you create on our cloud
  server, then you must create an account on this site so that
  your storage is separate from other people's storage.  When
  you create an account, we collect your email address or, if you are
  under 13, your parent's or guardian's email address.  We use
  your address for three purposes:</h2>
  <h2>
    <ol><a name="account" style="color: #000000; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;"><li>When you sign up for an account, we immediately send you
  a confirming email with your account's initial password.

  </li><li>If you forget your password, we use your address to send
  you a password-reset email.

  </li></a><li><a name="account" style="color: #000000; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">If your account is suspended for violation of our
  </a><a href="tos.html">Terms of Service</a><a name="account" style="color: #000000; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">,
  we will notify you by email.</a>
  </li></ol></h2>

  <h2>We do not use your address for any other purpose.  You will
  never receive marketing emails of any kind through this site,
  neither from us nor from third parties.</h2>

  <h2>We do not share your address with anyone else, except for
  companies contracted with us to provide services to us (see
  below, "for further questions").  Any such companies agree to obey this
  privacy policy.  The only exception is that we might be
  compelled by legal subpoena to provide information to police
  agencies or courts.</h2>

  <h2>We ask for your month and year of birth when you sign up in order
  to decide whether to ask for your own email address or your parent's
  email address.  But this partial birthdate information is never sent
  to our server; it is used only on your computer during the signup dialog.</h2>

  <h4>Information in your projects</h4>

  <h2>You can save projects on our server for your personal use,
  or you can explicitly choose to share a project with the other
  users of this site.</h2>

  <h2>We will never examine projects that you save privately on our
  site without your explicit permission (for example, if you
  report a bug that affects one of your projects).  Again, the
  only exception is that we might be compelled to provide
  information to government agencies.</h2>
  <h2>Projects that you choose to share are available for anyone
  to examine.  We may examine shared projects for research purposes.
  <i>We urge you strongly not to include personally identifying
  information in your shared projects!</i>  For example, if you post a
  project that says "today is my birthday" you are telling the
  entire world your date of birth, which is a very important piece
  of personally identifying information.</h2>
  <h2>If we are notified by a third party that your shared project
  includes their copyrighted content (such as a musical performance),
  we are required by law to investigate, and may revoke the shared
  status of that project.</h2>

  <h4>Communications that you initiate</h4>

  <h2>If you <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/contact.html">contact us</a> by email, we save
  your email address and whatever other information you include in
  your message long enough to respond to you, which might take some
  time if your message is a bug report.  We then delete your
  email.</h2>

  <h4>Server logging</h4>

  <h2>This site is hosted at the University of California, Berkeley,
  Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences Department.
  This web server collects the following information: Internet Protocol (IP)
  address of computer being used; web pages requested; referring web page;
  browser used; date and time; and statistics identifying particular IP
  addresses from which our websites are accessed. We do not associate this data
  to individual user identities.</h2>

  <h2>This
  information is used to improve the technical quality of the site,
  and may be used for investigation of deliberate attempts to deny the use
  of our site to others.  We do not log personally identifiable
  information, except that your IP address may indicate your
  Internet service provider and your general geographic area.</h2>

  <h2>The server for cloud storage of user accounts is maintained
  for us by the <a href="http://miosoft.com/">MioSoft</a> Corporation,
  which has agreed to follow this privacy policy.</h2>

  <h4>Google Analytics</h4>

  <h2>Like many other web sites, we use Google Analytics to collect
  statistical information about how our site is used.  We get only
  general statistical information from Google Analytics, not
  personally identifiable information.  <i>However, if you have ever
  used other Google services, then Google knows who you are.</i>  We have
  no control over their use of information; see
  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">Google's
  privacy policy</a> for more information.</h2>

  <h2>We recommend that you use
  <a href="http://adblockplus.org/">AdBlock Plus</a>,
  <a href="http://ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a>,
  <a href="http://noscript.org/">NoScript</a>, and/or
  <a href="http://privoxy.org/">Privoxy</a> to protect your browsing privacy.
  The first two are really easy to install and use; the last two take a bit
  more effort to whitelist sites you trust.
  (You might also consider the tracking-free
  <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> search engine.)
  We have no connection with any of those services.</h2>

  <h2>How to remove your information</h2>

  <h2>If you <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/delete-account.html">delete your account</a>
  on our site, we will delete all the information associated with
  that account, including your email and your saved projects.</h2>

  <h2>If you are the parent of a child with an account on this site
  and would like us to remove the account, please
  <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/contact.html">contact us</a>, and include in your
  message your child's account name, the email address associated
  with the account, and a way to contact you offline (to prevent
  forgeries).</h2>
